# World_Layoffs_EDA_Project 

## Overview  
This project explores the cleaned worldwide layoffs dataset to identify trends and key insights. Using SQL, we analyze patterns in layoffs across industries, regions, and time periods to provide valuable insights for stakeholders. The goal is to uncover meaningful data that can drive decision-making and further research.  

## Data Source  
- Dataset: Cleaned worldwide layoffs data  
- Contents: Company names, industries, locations, number of layoffs, total workforce, and layoff dates  

## Project Workflow  
1. Data Exploration (SQL):  
   - Queried and summarized layoff trends by industry, country, and time period.  
   - Identified peak layoff periods and potential correlations with external events.  
   - Analyzed workforce reductions relative to total company size.  
2. Trend Analysis: 
   - Compared layoffs across different sectors to identify high-risk industries.  
   - Measured year-over-year changes in layoffs.  
   - Detected geographic patterns in workforce reductions.  
3. Insights for Stakeholders:  
   - Highlighted industries with the most significant workforce reductions.  
   - Identified potential factors contributing to large-scale layoffs.  
   - Provided data-backed observations for future workforce planning.  

## Key Findings  
- Seasonal and economic trends affecting layoffs.
